# Elgentos Best Practices

This repository contains best coding practices, primarily focusing on PrismicIO use cases. It includes examples often used magento prismic elements. The different examples need to include the JSON as well as template, when applicable, and layout files. Only the relevant portion of the JSON for each Prismic element should be included. The examples for each element should be cojntained in a separate folder with a README file explaining the implementation of that element. The folder should contain at least a `.json` and layout `.xml` file (structure up for debate). 

Elements that may be included in this repository include static elements, slices, and often used Prismic pages such as landing pages, header and footer navigation, and "about us" pages.

## Notes on Development

In order for this repository to be useful, further work is needed; establish a folder structure, and include a comprehensive list of elements, pages, slices, and static elements. It may also be useful to include a list of useful Magento modules and their use cases. Alternatively, this repository could focus solely on PrismicIO elements, with links to projects where they are in use. If the scope of this repository expands beyond Prismic best practices, it is probably best to encapsulate the PrismicIO examples in their own folder.
