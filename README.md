# Elgentos Best Practices

This is a collection of prefered elgentos coding principles and examples. These examples mainly but not excluxsively comprise of of prismicIO use cases.

PrismicIO elements within this repo should contain the json used in prismic.io and examples of the template and layout files. Only the part of the json should be included that is part of that prismic element. The examples should be included in a seperate folder containing an readme for that element of the implementation of the element. The folder should at least contain a json and layout.xml file. A template file is optional as some implementations can use markup included in the layout.

Included can be static elements or ... or slices

## Often used prismic elements or pages

Included list of often used prismic magento elements/pages. By no means complete

- Landing page
- Header navigation
- Footer navigation
- about us page
- Usps
- [...more]

## Notes

For the prismic part alone a lot of work needs to be done for this repo to be of any use. It needs input on the setup of the project, folder structure and included elements/pages/slices/statuc elements and posibly more. 

Other often used magento elements can be added. Perhaps a list of usefull modules with their use cases. But a case could be made to keep this repository soley a list of prismicio elements with their basic implementations and perhaps links to projects where they are in use.
